# Take 5
Long Trip? Stuck on an Island? Just interested in talking about a subject with no real entry point for that conversation?

### Take 5 is for you!

Take 5 is a list based Social network (if you can belive it!) that allows users to list thiere Top 5 favortieâ€¦Things!

Let the world know your Top 5 "_Characters from the Harry Potter Series_" or you Top 5 "_Muscle Cars of the 1950s_". You can even list your Top 5 "_Freak Flags_" and let them Fly!

#### Technologies Used
Take 5 is Node based app that is deployed to Heroku. We've used a number of technologies in testing and development. Mocha, Chai, Sequelize and passport to name a few. 

#### Further Enhnacement
We think the potentail to expand about this app lies in its share-ability of lists. Broadening the ability to publish Users list to other social networks like Facebook and Instargram would allow *Take 5*
