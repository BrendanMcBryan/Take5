# Take 5
======
Stuck on a long trip? Shipwrecked on a deserted island? Interested in starting a conversation based on mutual interests but don't know how?

### TAKE 5 is for you!

TAKE 5 is a list-based social network (if you can believe it!) that allows users to list their Top 5 favorite anything!

Let the world know your Top 5 "_Characters from the Harry Potter Series_" or your Top 5 "_Muscle Cars of the 1950s_". You can even list your Top 5 "_Freak Flags_" and let them fly!

### Collaborators

This project was built by by Brendan, Cody, David, and Stephanie.

### Installation, prerequisites
TAKE 5 is browser based. No downloads necessary!

#### Technologies Used
TAKE 5 is Node based app that is deployed to Heroku. We've used a number of technologies and libraries in testing and development.  Sequelize, Passport, MySQL, and Handlebars, to name a few. 

# How it Works
First, the user makes an account. If they already have one, they can sign in. The app uses a Passport local strategy to authenticate users. From the authenticed profile page, users are able to make any amount of Top 5 lists they like. On the profile page, all the created lists are displayed. Also displayed is a list of the other users the user follows. 


#### Further Enhancement
* Broadening the ability to publish a list to other social networks like Facebook and Instagram would allow *Take 5* to be easily implemented and shared across platforms. 

* Another unifying concept that would really push this app forward is messaging. A user could reach out directly if they find that another user's lists are interesting or comparitively similar to their own.

* From another person's page, the user should be able to view the person's created Top 5 lists and click the 'follow' button to add them to their list of followers. 

* We also wanted to include a 'like' button that would count how many times other users liked a person's list. This count would be displayed as a single number on the person's profile page.
